                UTRA Hacks is Canada's emerging 2-day robotics hackathon hosted by the University of Toronto Robotics Association (UTRA) and the Robotics Institute. We aim to inspire creativity, enable collaboration and foster skill development. Participants connect face-to-face, collaborate with global students, and engage with industry leaders and mentors. The event sparks inspiration and opens minds to endless possibilities. Hackers of all experience levels can join workshops, tech talks, and career sessions to learn something new.

            <Accordion.Body>
            UTRA Hacks believes in enabling anyone from any background with any interest to come together and build impactful tech while having fun and meeting new people. UTRA Hacks is unique. We strive to: 1) facilitate hackers resting during the hackathon, 2) allow teams to gain meaningful feedback from industry professionals on their projects which they can use in future design projects, 3) get serious about robotics education by having teams mentored by passionate graduate students, 4) encourage collaboration between technical and non-technical backgrounds, and 5) develop and implement recommendations from consultations with EDIA and mental health community stakeholders and subject matter experts. Whether you're here to hone your robotics skillset, explore a new field, or meet new people, UTRA Hacks is here for you.

            <Accordion.Header>What are the themes for 2024 HACKS?</Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
                  <p>
                    This year's themes are: healthcare, space and the environment! 
                    These themes provide a specific focus on robotics and encourage participants to think about 
                    how robots can make a positive impact on everyday life and beyond. We encourage participants to 
                    make their project their own. (For example, autonomous vehicles could fit into any category depending 
                    on how you frame your robot!) It allows participants to explore a wide range of applications and 
                    challenges, catering to both beginners and professionals.
