          At UTRA, we aim to inspire creativity, enable collaboration and
          foster skill development. Participants can connect face-to-face,
          collaborate with global students, and engage with industry leaders
          and mentors. The event sparks inspiration and opens minds to endless
          possibilities. Hackers of all experience levels can join workshops,
          tech talks, and career sessions to learn something new. UTRA Hacks
          supports participants by providing necessary equipment, so that the
          sky's the limit!
